It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
 The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still 
in their infancy. Various 
versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney  
College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the w
ord in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
 (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
 The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "
de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 
translation by H. Rackham.

"On the other hand,
 we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
 are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded 
 by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal 
 blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying 
 through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour,
 when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every 
 pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the o
 bligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man th
 erefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, o
 r else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
